    <h2>AI & Data Science</h2>
    <p>
    I'm fascinated by how AI can solve real-world problems, so most of my projects start with "what if we could..." questions.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Turkish Social Media Analysis:</strong> I got curious about understanding sentiment in Turkish tweets - turns out it's trickier than English because of the language nuances. I fine-tuned VRLLab/TurkishBERTweet on small datasets and built models that can actually tell whether people are being genuine or sarcastic in their posts.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Smart Agriculture Solutions:</strong> Working with hyperspectral imaging for fruit ripeness detection was like solving a puzzle - you have hundreds of spectral bands but need to find the ones that actually matter. I used PCA and CARS to cut through the noise and was surprised how well classical Random Forest performed alongside AlexNet. I also built cow behavior tracking systems for predicting estrus, which sounds niche but is actually crucial for farmers. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Object Detection & Tracking:</strong> YOLOv8 became my go-to for real-time detection projects. There's something satisfying about watching objects move smoothly across video frames when you combine it with SORT algorithms for vehicle tracking.

    <h2>Data Engineering & Analysis</h2>
    <p>
    Half the work in AI is getting your data right, and I've learned this the hard way through lots of trial and error. I build Python workflows that handle everything from scraping tweets with Selenium (while respecting rate limits) to cleaning messy datasets and preparing them for analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
    I spend a lot of time with Pandas and NumPy doing exploratory data analysis - those moments when you finally spot the pattern in your data make all the debugging worth it. My approach is straightforward: get the data, understand what you're actually looking at, clean it properly, and document everything so you can reproduce your results later.

    <h2>Machine Learning Projects</h2>
    <p>
    I'm more interested in creating <strong>working prototypes that people can understand and use</strong> rather than claiming I've built the next revolutionary AI system. Every project I work on, I ask myself: "Does this actually solve a problem? Can someone else understand how it works?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Whether I'm fine-tuning BERT models for sentiment analysis or implementing computer vision systems for agriculture, I focus on building things that are practical and honest about their limitations. I'd rather have a simple model that works consistently than a complex one that fails unexpectedly. The field moves fast, but I think the fundamentals matter: clean data, understandable code, and solutions that address real problems.
